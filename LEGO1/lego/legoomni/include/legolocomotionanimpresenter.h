 * @brief [AI] Specialized presenter class for handling locomotion animation playback and state in the LEGO Island game engine.
 * 
 * @details [AI] LegoLocomotionAnimPresenter is a subclass of LegoLoopingAnimPresenter, designed to manage animation sequences that are associated with locomotion (movement) of game entities. It manages additional internal lists for ROI (real-time object instance) mapping and controls the tickle/process state flow for animations bound to moving actors. It integrates with the variable table to dynamically assign variables used during animation binding.
